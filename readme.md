Interactive Data
====
This is for the "Future of Interaction" symposium at Cornell University on
Thursday, April 4, 2013.

Things to consider talking about.

* "Data"?
  * Today, it's cheap to collect information, store it in computers, and use
      math to learn something from the information.
    * Examples
  * Aside from its utility, "data" and empiricism are sexy.
    * Harvard Business Review
    * Nate Silver
    * White House
    * Data scientology
* "Interactive"? Answer with yes, no or an abstention
    (irrelevent, don't care, not a useful dichotomy)
  * Is this ordinary plot interactive?
  * Is fancy data journaly thing interactive?
  * What about this ordinary plot that moves uselessly when you click on it?
  * What about this static plot that conveys stories?
